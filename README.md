# Karting Simulator Project

## Overview
This project is a Karting Simulator developed in C++ using the OpenGL library. It provides a simple and interactive environment where users can control a kart within a 3D world.

## Prerequisites
Before running the simulator, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
- GLFW
- GLAD
- GLM
- STB Image

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure to include the required dependencies in your project.
3. Build and run the project.

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to control the camera's movement.
- Press 'W' to accelerate the kart forward.
- Press 'S' to reverse the kart.
- Press 'A' and 'D' to steer the kart left and right, respectively.
- Press '1' to switch to first-person camera mode.
- Press 'R' to reset the camera position.
- Press 'ESC' to exit the simulator.


## Acknowledgments
- This project relies on the GLFW, GLAD, GLM, and STB Image libraries.
